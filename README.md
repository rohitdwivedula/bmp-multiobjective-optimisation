# Optimisation of BMP Placements in GHMC Area

Code for optimising placement of Best Management Practices (BMPs) in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area, Telangana, India. This repo contains:

1. code for running NSGA-III and C-TAEA multiobjective optimisation algorithms (see folder `multiobjective`) [1].
2. code for running fuzzy optimisation with single objective genetic algorithms and three different membership functions (see folder `fuzzy`) [2].

## Setup

It is recommended to run all code within a Python virtual environment. To create an environment and install dependencies:

1. Create a `python3` environment using the bash commands `virtualenv .venv` or any similar command. 
2. Activate the environment using `source .venv/bin/activate`.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required libraries.

Your environment is now ready to run the code!

## Data
Our work uses data from the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area to perform this optimization. Data is formatted/stored as `.shp` files that can be opened using almost any `GIS` software or in Python using the `geopandas` library. The `data` directory contains sample `.shp` and other files as a representation of the data format. Please note that these files contain **only** the data format - not the actual complete dataset itself.

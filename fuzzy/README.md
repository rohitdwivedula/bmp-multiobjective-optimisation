# Fuzzy Optimisation
This directiory contains:

- `fuzzy_optimise.py`, the source code for running fuzzy optimisation. Use `python3 fuzzy_optimise.py --help` to get instructions on how to use the file.
- `final_results`, containing the results presented in the paper in both .csv and graphical formats. 
- The `final_results` folder contains three subfolders: `exp0` (results for **hyperbolic** membership function), `exp1` (exponential membership function) and `exp2` (**nonlinear membership function**).
- The file `optimisation_progress.csv` provides results on the convergence of the optimisation approaches with each set of parameters.
- Files `hyperbolic.csv`, `exponential.csv` and `nonlinear.csv` contain the final results obtained at the end of optimisation.
